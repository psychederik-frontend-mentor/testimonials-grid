          I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned
          were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I

          ‚Äú I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp.
          I‚Äôve been looking to make a transition and have heard some
          people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the
          free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled
          shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most
          grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I‚Äôve
          successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer
          at a VR startup. ‚Äù

          Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp

          ‚Äú Before joining the bootcamp, I‚Äôve never written a line of
          code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help
          me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll
          by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful
          things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did
          not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to
          wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in
          particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next
          level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I‚Äôve
          often referred to it during interviews as an example of my
          developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a
          full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100%
          recommend! ‚Äù
